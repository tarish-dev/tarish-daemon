# Integrating `barqd`

What a platform integrator has to provide, and the failures worth knowing about
before hitting them. Everything here was found the hard way on GrapheneOS for
Pixel 10; none of it is GrapheneOS-specific.

## What barqd needs from the platform

**An AWDL library.** `libmosey_daemon_ffi.so` must be present and loadable.
barqd tries the plain soname first (so the dynamic linker's own search applies),
then `/system_ext/lib64`, `/vendor/lib64`, `/system/lib64`, and honours
`BARQ_MOSEY_LIB` as an override. **Shipping and pinning that library is the
integrator's job, not the daemon's** — barqd only requires that one is there.

**A kernel driver.** `wonder.ko`, bound to the Wi-Fi driver. On Pixel 10 that is
every model except the 10a, whose `bcmdhd4383` has no `wondertap` support at all.
Note the driver is kernel-version-pinned (vermagic plus a RANDSTRUCT seed), so it
cannot be carried between kernels — if a vendor image drops it, an archived copy
does not help.

**A product package and SELinux policy.**

```make
PRODUCT_PACKAGES += barqd
```

```
sepolicy/barqd.te
sepolicy/file_contexts
```

## Install `file_contexts`, not just the `.te`

This is the one that wastes a day.

`sepolicy/barqd.te` defines the domain; `sepolicy/file_contexts` labels
`/system_ext/bin/barqd` so `init` can transition into it. Install only the first
and **the build still succeeds**, the domain is present in the compiled policy,
and `barqd` runs — in `init`'s domain, not its own. Everything looks right except
that the domain is inert.

Many integration paths handle `.te` and `seapp_contexts` but not
`file_contexts`, because apps are labelled through `seapp_contexts` and daemons
are the first thing that needs the other file.

## The SELinux policy is not negotiable, and trimming it costs cycles

`barqd.te` is derived from the vendor daemon's own policy. Every rule is there
because the same work through the same library needs it. Three rounds of
trimming what "looked unnecessary" produced three failures, each costing a full
build-and-flash:

| Removed | Symptom |
|---|---|
| `map` on `packet_socket` | `PcapError("can't mmap rx ring: Permission denied")` — the library uses libpcap with `PACKET_MMAP` |
| all `allowxperm` rules | `avc: denied { ioctl } ... ioctlcmd=0x54ca` — `TUNSETIFF`, so the interface could not be created **even though plain `ioctl` was allowed** |
| — | see below |

**`allowxperm` is easy to miss entirely.** Granting `ioctl` on a class is not
enough on Android: individual command numbers must also be whitelisted, and the
denial reports the command (`ioctlcmd=0x...`) rather than saying an xperm is
missing.

Only trim a rule with a denial log proving it unused.

## barqd deliberately cannot execute anything

The link-local route is added with `RTM_NEWROUTE` over netlink rather than by
running `ip`. Exec'ing it needs

```
allow barqd system_file:file execute_no_trans;
```

which lets the daemon run **any** system binary — far too broad a grant to buy
one route. Sixty lines of netlink needs no permission beyond the
`netlink_route_socket` already held, so the domain grants no exec at all. If you
are tempted to add that rule, you are solving the wrong problem.

## The routing trap

An address on the interface is not enough. Android routes by **fwmark** and gives
a new interface its own routing table — which starts **empty**. `connect()`
returns `ENETUNREACH` despite a valid address and a reachable neighbour in the
table.

barqd adds `fe80::/64` to the interface's own table at startup. If you see
`ENETUNREACH` on a link that otherwise looks healthy, check the per-interface
table rather than `main`.

## Things that look like failure and are not

- **`wonder0` has no address.** The usable interface is **`mosey0`**. `wonder0`
  is the underlying wiphy netdev.
- **The interface disappears.** The AWDL session lives exactly as long as the
  process holding the handle. That is why barqd does nothing but hold it, and why
  a client app must never be the holder.
- **ICMP gets no reply.** Apple devices generally do not answer pings on AWDL.
  AirDrop is TCP to a port discovered over mDNS, so a silent ping is not a
  broken link.

## Verifying an install

```
init.svc.barqd = running
context        = u:r:barqd:s0        user = system
barqd: AWDL session up, handle=0x..., channel=149
barqd: route: fe80::/64 dev mosey0 table <ifindex>
mosey0  fe80::.../64
```

with **zero** AVC denials for `barqd` and **zero** notifications. If the library
refuses to start, read logcat for `mosey_daemon` before touching any code — it
reports how it parsed every argument, and each wrong one names its own mistake.
